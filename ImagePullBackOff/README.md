# Kubernetes ImagePullBackOff Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to resolve the `ImagePullBackOff` error in Kubernetes by configuring a Docker registry secret using a custom `docker-config.json` file for authentication with Docker Hub.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
- A working Kubernetes cluster.
- Access to the Kubernetes server where you will configure the secret.
- Docker Hub account with credentials (username and token).
- Your Kubernetes setup can pull images from a private registry.

## Steps to Resolve `ImagePullBackOff` Error

### 1. **Create the `docker-config.json` File**

First, we will create the `docker-config.json` file which stores the Docker Hub credentials in the correct format for Kubernetes.

#### 1.1 Create `docker-config.json`

Run the following commands to create the `docker-config.json` file, which will store your Docker Hub credentials (username, password/token, and email).

```bash
cat <<EOF > /root/kubernetes/docker-config.json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "username": "gchauhan1517",
      "password": "$(cat /root/kubernetes/token-file)",
      "email": "gchauhan1517.ca20@chitkara.edu.in"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

- Replace the username `gchauhan1517` with your Docker Hub username.
- Replace the email `gchauhan1517.ca20@chitkara.edu.in` with your Docker Hub email.
- Ensure the `/root/kubernetes/token-file` contains your Docker Hub token (create it in Docker Hub if not done already).

#### 1.2 Verify the File

Ensure that the `docker-config.json` file is created by running:

```bash
ls /root/kubernetes/docker-config.json
```

You should see the file listed in the output.

---

### 2. **Create the Kubernetes Secret from the `docker-config.json` File**

Now that the `docker-config.json` file is created, you need to use it to create a Kubernetes secret, which will allow Kubernetes to authenticate with Docker Hub.

#### 2.1 Create the Secret

Run the following command to create the Kubernetes secret using the `docker-config.json` file:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic docker-registry-credentials \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/root/kubernetes/docker-config.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

- This command will create a Kubernetes secret named `docker-registry-credentials` using the credentials stored in the `docker-config.json` file.
- The `--type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` specifies the type of secret, telling Kubernetes that it's used for Docker registry authentication.

---

### 3. **Modify Your Deployment YAML to Use the Secret**

In order for Kubernetes to use the Docker registry secret when pulling the image, you need to update your deployment YAML file.

#### 3.1 Update `nginx-deployment.yaml`

Add the `imagePullSecrets` section to your deployment configuration. Here's an example `nginx-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: gchauhan1517/imagepullbackoff-image  # Replace with your actual image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: docker-registry-credentials  # Reference to the secret for pulling the image
```

- **`imagePullSecrets`**: This tells Kubernetes to use the `docker-registry-credentials` secret for authenticating with Docker Hub when pulling the image.
- Replace the `image` value with the correct image path from your Docker Hub account.

#### 3.2 Apply the Deployment Configuration

To apply the updated deployment configuration, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

This will update your deployment and Kubernetes will now use the provided secret to pull the image from Docker Hub.

---

### 4. **Verify the Deployment**

After applying the deployment configuration, check the status of your pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

If everything is configured correctly, the pods should be in the `Running` state. If you still face issues, use the following command to troubleshoot:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for the `Events` section to identify any potential issues, such as `ImagePullBackOff` errors.

---

### 5. **Check the Secret in Kubernetes**

You can verify that the secret was created successfully by running:

```bash
kubectl get secret docker-registry-credentials -o yaml
```

This will show the details of the secret, but note that the credentials will be base64 encoded. You can decode them if necessary:

```bash
echo "<encoded-token>" | base64 --decode
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- **`ImagePullBackOff`**: This indicates that Kubernetes is unable to pull the image due to authentication failure. Make sure that the secret is created correctly and is referenced in your deployment YAML.
  
- **`ErrImagePull`**: This error occurs when the image cannot be pulled from the registry. Ensure the image name is correct, and the secret used for authentication is valid.

---

## Conclusion

This guide outlines the steps to resolve the `ImagePullBackOff` error in Kubernetes by creating a Docker registry secret using a custom `docker-config.json` file and updating the deployment YAML to use this secret for pulling images.

By following the steps above, Kubernetes should successfully pull the image from Docker Hub without encountering authentication issues. If further issues arise, verify the credentials in the secret and check the Kubernetes pod logs for more details.
